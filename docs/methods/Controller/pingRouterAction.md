# pingRouterAction([string $target, datetime $from (optional), datetime $to (optional)])
This method is used to retrieve the saved results of a ping scan. It takes three parameters, the target IP address, and optional start and end date/time values to filter the results. If no start and end date/time values are provided, the method will return all saved results for the target IP address.
